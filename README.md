## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/analiviag/weatherreact.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd weatherreact
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Get your API Key:**

    - Sign up on [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to get your free API key.

5.  **Create an Environment File:**

    - In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
    - Add your API key to this file. **Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_`**.
      ```
      VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
      ```

6.  **Update the Code to Use the Environment Variable:**

    - To keep your API key secure, we need to read it from the environment file. Open `src/App.jsx` and replace the hardcoded `apiKey` with the following:
      ```javascript
      // In src/App.jsx
      const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY;
      ```

7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
